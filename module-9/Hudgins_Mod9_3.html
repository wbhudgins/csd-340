    <p>President Whitmore's Speech</p>
    <p>Good morning. In less than an hour, aircrafts from here will join others from around the world, and you will be
        launching the largest <span id="first">_________</span> battle in the history of mankind. Mankind, that word should
        have new meaning for all of us today.</p>
    
    <p>We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore; we will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate
        that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression,
        or persecution -- but from annihilation. We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. To prove that we are still
        a vibrant, living species, capable of defending our <span id="second">_________</span>.</p>
    
    <p>And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the
        world declared in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're going
        to live on! We're going to survive!" Today, we celebrate our <span id="third">_________</span> Day! And together, as
        a united planet, we move forward with <span id="fourth">_________</span> into the future.</p>
